# Lemmy v0.19.1 Release

## What is Lemmy?

Lemmy is a self-hosted social link aggregation and discussion platform. It is completely free and open, and not controlled by any company. This means that there is no advertising, tracking, or secret algorithms. Content is organized into communities, so it is easy to subscribe to topics that you are interested in, and ignore others. Voting is used to bring the most interesting items to the top.

## Major Changes

0.19.0 has a critical bug where sending outgoing activities can stop working. The bug is fixed in this version. It also fixes the "hide read posts" user setting, fixes a problem with invalid comment paths, and another fix for private message reports.

## Upgrade instructions

Follow the upgrade instructions for [ansible](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ansible#upgrading) or [docker](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/administration/install_docker.html#updating). The upgrade should take less than 30 minutes.

If you need help with the upgrade, you can ask in our [support forum](https://lemmy.ml/c/lemmy_support) or on the [Matrix Chat](https://matrix.to/#/!OwmdVYiZSXrXbtCNLw:matrix.org).

## Thanks to everyone

We'd like to thank our many contributors and users of Lemmy for coding, translating, testing, and helping find and fix bugs. We're glad many people find it useful and enjoyable enough to contribute.

## Support development

We (@dessalines and @nutomic) have been working full-time on Lemmy for over three years. This is largely thanks to support from [NLnet foundation](https://nlnet.nl/), as well as [donations from individual users](https://join-lemmy.org/donate).

This month we are running a funding drive with the goal of increasing recurring donations from currently €4.000 to at least €12.000. With this amount @dessalines and @nutomic can each receive a yearly salary of €50.000 which is in line with median developer salaries. It will also allow one additional developer to work fulltime on Lemmy and speed up development.
