# Lemmy v0.18.4 Release (2023-08-08)

_Written by @nutomic, 2023-08-08_

## What is Lemmy?

Lemmy is a self-hosted social link aggregation and discussion platform. It is completely free and open, and not controlled by any company. This means that there is no advertising, tracking, or secret algorithms. Content is organized into communities, so it is easy to subscribe to topics that you are interested in, and ignore others. Voting is used to bring the most interesting items to the top.

## Major Changes

This version fixes the problem of comment context not loading properly. It also fixes a couple other bugs.

## Support development

@dessalines and @nutomic are working full-time on Lemmy to integrate community contributions, fix bugs, optimize performance and much more. This work is funded exclusively through donations.

If you like using Lemmy, and want to make sure that we will always be available to work full time building it, consider [donating to support its development](https://join-lemmy.org/donate). No one likes recurring donations, but theyâ€™ve proven to be the only way that open-source software like Lemmy can stay independent and alive.
