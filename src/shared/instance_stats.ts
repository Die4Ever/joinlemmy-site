                "Code of Conduct\n-\n\n_(To view a full list of our rules for users, see the final section of this page.)_\n\nThis page contains the goals, principles, and rules for participating in Lemmy.World, with some additional information about our platform. It is intended to protect all our members from bad actors, and to ensure that our platform is as welcoming and inclusive as possible. Keep in mind that this is a working document, and so the Lemmy.World team may amend it from time to time.\n\n**All significant changes made on this page will be announced to our users.**\n\n_____\n  \nGoals\n-\n  \t                       \t\n- Provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all members; regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or other similar characteristic. Human comes first. \n\n- Create a supportive environment, where people freely share their passions and are excited and positive about each other’s successes.\n\n- Protect our community from harassment, malicious or illegal content, and from bad actors, whose goals are to disrupt our community and promote their own self-interest at the expense of others.\n\n_____\n\nPrinciples that Guide Us\n-\n\n- We are not a free speech zone. This Code of Conduct lays out the expected standards of conduct and behavior. Users may not say or post anything that violates these rules, and all participants are required to follow this code. If you disagree with this code, you are welcome to keep looking for other Lemmy instances.  [Here's a list of all public instances.](https://lemmyverse.net/)\n\n- The moderators are not morality or thought police. They are guided by this Code of Conduct. Post what you want, as long as your post follows the rules, principles, and goals outlined on this page. Not every user will appreciate controversial or explicit posts, so feel encouraged to use NSFW marks very liberally. We use NSFW marks often so the members themselves may decide whether they want to see a post that might be controversial or explicit. \n\n- Bullies, trolls, and disruptors are not welcome in Lemmy.World. We will moderate accordingly.\n\n- This is a voluntary community. You chose to be here. When you choose to join, you have implied that you agree with this Code of Conduct and will follow it.\n\n____\n\nGeneral Guidance for Participating\n-\n\n**Here is a general guidance for participating in Lemmy.World:**\n\n- Do not post about inflammatory or controversial subjects without a NSFW mark. Ideally, you would not post about inflammatory subjects at all. However, it may be acceptable to do so in some cases, but it is never acceptable to post inflammatory content without hiding the content behind the appropriate NSFW warning.\n\n- Do not post any type of nudity without marking it NSFW.\n\n- Regarding spam: we are not your free advertising platform. If you are here only to sell your products or services, you will be removed. Occasional posts of commercial links are tolerated, but when the vast majority of a user's posts are commercial in nature, we regard the account as a Spam account. Moderators will evaluate reports of Spam on a case by case basis.\n\n- Do not engage in name calling, [ad hominem](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ad%20hominem) attacks, [sealioning](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sealioning) or any other uncivil behaviour. Remember to criticise ideas, and not people.\n\n- Don’t report every post that upsets you. Please do report posts that violate our rules or a community’s rules, but for others that you may find distasteful, or just don’t like, use the tools available to you. You can block the user, and you can also block communities.\n\n- A full list of rules is included on the final section of this page.\n\n____\n\nModeration Principles\n-\n\nWhen a user violates any of the points described in our Code of Conduct, our team may suspend an account from Lemmy.World. This may happen when a user has breached any rule several times, or if their content suggests that they are likely to continue to break the rules. The number of breaches leading to suspension is deliberately not defined. In egregious cases, one breach can result in suspension of the user account.\n\nThe team takes a pragmatic approach to every situation - if they feel that a problematic post isn’t explicitly a breach of any of these rules but is inappropriate for Lemmy.World, the post will likely be removed. Users who repeatedly post problematic content or otherwise are seen by the team as a negative, disruptive presence in our community can be removed at the discretion of our team, even if those posts or the user did not explicitly violate our rules.\n\n____\n\nStaff\n-\n\n**This instance has the following administrators:**\n\n- [@Ruud](https://lemmy.world/u/ruud) (CET/CEST)\n- [@Antik](https://lemmy.world/u/antik) (CET/CEST)\n- [@MichelleG](https://lemmy.world/u/MichelleG) (CT)\n- [@AvaddonLFC](https://lemmy.world/u/clueless_stoner) (EST)\n- [@Xylinna](https://lemmy.world/u/xylinna) (EST)\n- [@Quinten](https://lemmy.world/u/Quinten) (CET/CEST)\n\n**This instance is kept up and running by the following heroes:**\n\n- [@Jelloeater](https://lemmy.world/u/jelloeater85) (EST)\n- [@TragicNotCute](https://lemmy.world/u/TragicNotCute) (CT)\n- @ld_50\n- [@Ruud](https://lemmy.world/u/ruud) and [@Antik](https://lemmy.world/u/antik), who are also administrators of the site.\n\n**Operations helpers:**\n- [@Rooki](https://lemmy.world/u/Rooki) (CET/CEST)\n\nA special thanks to them for their countless helpful efforts. \n____\n\nDonations &amp; Finances \t\n-\n\nLemmy.World is run by [@Ruud](https://lemmy.world/u/ruud), who also pays the bills.\n\n Since the June 2023 user influx, those bills have gone up quite steeply.\n For those who would like to contribute, the following options for donations are available:\n\n- [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/mastodonworld) (Either recurring or one-time donations) - Preferred.\n- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mastodonworld) (Recurring donations only)        \t\n\nThe running costs of Lemmy.World currently consist of:\n\n- Hetzner server\n- Hetzner backup server\n- Hetzner cloud VPS for monitoring, blog etc\n- Mailgun e-mailer      \t\n- CloudFlare CDN (Need to switch to paid plan)\n- Monthly updates about the finances can be found at our blog\n\n____\n\nStatus / Uptime\n-\n                  \t\nYou can view our status and uptime from this site, a service provided by [@Jelloeater](https://lemmy.world/u/jelloeater85). \nGeneral Fediverse information can be viewed at [this site](http://lemmy-status.org).\n\n_____\n \nInstance Images\n-\n\nA special thank you to @vsp for giving us an amazing logo and banner!\n\n_____\n \n Our Rules for Users\n-\n\nHere’s a full list of our rules for users.

If you harass, disturb or discriminate against any individual member, you will be removed.

No encouragement or promotion of self-harm.\n14. “Shitposting” will only be allowed in their dedicated communities.\n15. You may not abuse the reporting function. Don’t report every post that upsets you. Please do report posts that violate our rules or a community’s rules, but for others that you may find distasteful, or just don’t like, use the tools available to you.

                "> If there's content from communities you don't want to see, then [**switch your default view type to `Subscribed`**](https://lemmynsfw.com/settings). You can also **block** the communities you don't wish to interact with **at all**. Also for finding communities combining those existing in the fediverse as well as within this instance, use [lemmyverse.net/communities](https://lemmyverse.net/communities)\n\n# Rules\nBefore you start participating, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our rules:\n\n1. (Rule One) 🔞 **Age Requirement**: All users and lurkers MUST be age 18 or over.\n  \n-  a. Posting content involving any person who is under 18 is strictly **forbidden**. This includes real, drawn, and fictional content.\n-  b. **All loli/shota/cub** or similar content is strictly **forbidden**.\n\n2. (Rule Two)  **Respect and Consent**: Treat all members with respect and obtain consent when sharing explicit content involving others. No doxxing. No soliciting or sharing personal info. No homophobia, transphobia, body shaming, or kinkshaming. **Don’t be an asshole.**\n\n3. (Rule Three) **No NSFL/Gore/Snuff Content**: We strictly **forbid** the sharing or promotion of NSFL (Not Safe For Life) or gore content. **This includes fictional snuff scenarios.**\n\n4. (Rule Four) **No Bestiality/Zoophilia**: We strictly **forbid** any NSFW content involving animals.\n\n5. (Rule Five) **No Non-Consensual Content**: We strictly **forbid** content made or released **without consent** of everyone in the content, including revenge porn / deepfakes / leaked content / NC / true voyeur / rape content.\n\n6. (Rule Six) **No Illegal Content**: - We strictly **forbid** promotion and detailed discussion of things that are broadly illegal in most of the world, like murder, animal cruelty, money laundering, and so on. Our policy on mind-altering substances is more complicated – [see the FAQ (its in the table of contents to the right). ](https://docs.lemmynsfw.com/docs/faq/)\n  \n-  a. Solicitation of sexual services (either way, asking or offering) is strictly forbidden. [(why?)](https://docs.lemmynsfw.com/docs/policy/solictation/)\n\n7. (Rule Seven) **NSFW Flag**: All NSFW communities and posts **must be flagged** as NSFW.\n\n8. (Rule Eight) **No Rules Lawyering: Admin decisions are final and arguing with them can result in a suspension or banning of your account and removal of your content.** (if you feel a community is not being sufficiently moderated or properly following these guidelines, please contact an admin.)\n\nIf any material is ambiguous or borderline forbidden content, **we’re usually going to err on the side of caution.** Please use your common sense. \n\nThis is a condensed form of our rules. If you want to read further discussion into the rules above, our reasonings behind our decisions, general knowledge about the instance and things generally our team would like you to know [please click here to visit our docs page](https://docs.lemmynsfw.com/).\n\n**All users and communities must follow and respect these general instance-wide rules. Any violations could result in suspension or banning of your account or community and purging of your content.**\n\n# Community Guidelines\n\n1. **Stay Relevant**: Share relevant content in the relevant communities and ensure your content complies with the rules of those communities.\n\n2. **Self-Promotion**: Self-Promotion is only okay as long as the community you are posting in allows it, and you don’t spam it.\n\n3. **Content Sourcing** - We would strongly prefer all content be credited and sourced if possible, to make it easier to keep CSAM and noncon off of the instance. [See the FAQ for more info.](https://docs.lemmynsfw.com/docs/faq/) \n\n4. **Furry Content** - Furry content is allowed (unless it conflicts with any other rules) but furries may be better served at https://pawb.social/ or https://yiffit.net/.\n\n# Temporary Rules\n\nBecause of technical limitations of the Lemmy platform, we are forced to implement some restrictions on content. These are restrictions that don’t necessarily fit with our larger philosophy. **We hope to revise this section** once Lemmy evolves as a platform and moderation tools improve.\n\n1. **NSFW User Avatar**: NSFW user avatars are prohibited as it is currently not possible to mark users as NSFW. NSFW user banners are also prohibited.\n\n2. **Temporary Content Restrictions**: The following content is temporarily restricted: Hot lunch (🤮), blood, scat, CNC. \n\nIf you are the admin of another instance and you have any issues with Lemmy NSFW please raise it with one of our admins so we can communicate on how we can improve this instance. We would prefer to work with you before either of us consider defederation.\n\n___\n# Contact\n###### Mail: contact@lemmynsfw.com\n###### Mastodon: [@lemmynsfw@mastodon.world](https://mastodon.world/@lemmynsfw)\n###### Matrix public operations room (SFW only): [#lemmynsfw:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#lemmynsfw:matrix.org)\n\n___\n# Donations\n- [Trocador.app (crypto)](https://trocador.app/anonpay/?ticker_to=eth&amp;network_to=ERC20&amp;address=0x4E4Af5Dc2f86235Ac496542c2A1C00F3C4de40C6&amp;donation=True&amp;simple_mode=True&amp;amount=0.01&amp;name=Lemmy+NSFW&amp;email=xaeg@lemmynsfw.com&amp;ref=0C6W5QQozK&amp;ticker_from=eth&amp;network_from=ERC20)",

You can also join our community [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZtZzR6TWs2) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/%23beehaw:matrix.org) servers. You can also view our [status page](https://status.beehaw.org).\n\nOur most up to date [FAQ can be found here](https://docs.beehaw.org/docs/faq/).\n\nDownvotes are disabled on this instance.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nWe're a collective of individuals upset with the way social media has been traditionally governed. A severe lack of moderation has led to major platforms like Facebook to turn into political machinery focused on disinformation campaigns as a way to make profit off of users. Websites with ineffective moderation allow hate speech to proliferate and contribute to the erosion of minority rights and safe spaces. Our goal with Beehaw is to demonstrate and promote a healthier environment.\n\nOur philosophy: \n* [What is Beehaw?](https://docs.beehaw.org/docs/core-principles/what-is-beehaw/)\n* [The spirit of the rules](https://docs.beehaw.org/docs/core-principles/the-spirit-of-beehaw/)\n* [Beehaw is a Community](https://docs.beehaw.org/docs/core-principles/beehaw-is-a-community/)\nand more on our [Docs Website](https://docs.beehaw.org/)\n\nOperating our server costs money. If you donate, you should know that 100% of the costs will go towards server time, licensing costs, and artwork. In the future if we need to hire developers or other labor, it would be sourced through the [Open Collective Foundation](https://opencollective.com/beehaw), and it would be transparent to the community before any changes were made.\n\n---\n\nAs a news aggregator and a social media outlet, with a focus on being a safe and accepting space, we strive to create a positive social impact. We will, also, help to connect underprivileged and minority individuals with education and civic participation by promoting a healthier online experience.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nOur community icons were made by Aaron Schneider under the [CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\n\n---\n![](https://status.beehaw.org/api/v1/endpoints/beehaw_beehaw/health/badge.svg) \n![if you can see this, it's up](https://status.beehaw.org/api/v1/endpoints/beehaw_beehaw/uptimes/24h/badge.svg)\n&nbsp;",

It means not telling people that you know their experiences better than they do. It means not gatekeeping experiences of identities of others. It means no bigotry such as racism, sexism, anti LGBT commentary, ableism etc. It means doing your best to ensure that you don't over-talk the voices of folk who don't share your privileges.\n\n**Supporting Blåhaj Lemmy**\n\nAfter much hesitation, [we have a Ko Fi](https://ko-fi.com/blahajzone) to enable people to help with supporting some of the running costs associated with our instances. \n\nProviding a safe space for our community is the goal, so please only consider donating if you are in a position to do so without *any* financial stress. \n\n",

The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal\ninformation and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your\nengagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and\naccessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that\nLemmygrad.ml does not own or control, or to individuals that Lemmygrad.ml does not employ or manage.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging\nspace of free open communication on the internet.  **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING\nTHAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY\nEXPERIMENTAL.  ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR\nPERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM\nDEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.** \n\n**You also understand that there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP\naddress. However due to the nature of federated services, all of your *engagement* (your\nprofile;posts;comments;messages;votes) on this platform should be considered public. We feel that\nproper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to\nengage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on\nLemmygrad.ml, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n\n# **What information do we collect?**\n\n* **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you will be asked to enter a\n  username, a password, an optionally an e-mail address. You may also enter additional profile\n  information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username,\n  display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n* **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**:  When you post, the date\n  and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain\n  media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly.\n  Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is\n  available publicly. Your posts, comments and votes are delivered to the communities they are\n  posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored\n  there. When you delete posts, comments and votes, this is likewise broadcast to other instances,\n  however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all\n  instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting\n  record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. Communities you\n  subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are\n  not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions\n  which result in it becoming publicly viewable. This service interoperates with other federated\n  services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function\n  differently than it does on Lemmy.  \n  **In essence, your email address remains private to this local instance, however due to the nature\n  of federated services all *engagement* (your profile;posts;comments;messages;votes) should be\n  considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do\n  not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.** \n* **Direct messages**: **Direct messages are stored as plain text in the PostgreSQL database. For\n  encrypted communication, please use a dedicated platform like Matrix.** In some cases, messages\n  are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to\n  limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail\n  to do so.  Therefore it's important to review the instances of users you are engaging with.\n  **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such\n  messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share\n  any sensitive information over Lemmy direct messages.**\n* **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we do not record the IP address you log in from. We\n  retain the name of your browser application. We may retain server logs which do not include the IP\n  address from which requests are made to the server.\n\n\n# **What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n* To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people's content and\n  post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities\n  for content discovery.\n* To aid moderation of the community.\n* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other\n  people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or\n  other requests or questions.\n\n\n# **How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when\nyou enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as\nwell as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password\nis hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. \n\nWe are disclosing that Lemmy currently does not support SSL for PostgreSQL. This instance has\nmitigated this security risk by running the PostgreSQL service on the same host as the instance\nbackend, and has blocked all incoming and outgoing network connections to the PostgreSQL service.\n\nThe PostgreSQL database is regularly back up by the instance administrators.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that third-party clients will not steal the user's login credentials. When using\na client other than the official web client (located at https://lemmygrad.ml). it is the user's\nreponsibility to secure their credentials. Using a trusted, open-source client helps with this.\n\n# **What is our data retention policy?**\n\nWe do not retain the IP addresses of the users of our instance.\n\nYou may irreversibly delete your account at any time. **However, this does not guarantee all\ninstances will be notified or respect the deletion of your public data.**\n\n# **Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard\ndrive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your\nbrowser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.\n\n# **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable\ninformation. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site,\nconducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information\nconfidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply\nwith the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and community\nposts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to\nthe servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different\nserver than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you\napprove, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and\nyour voting history. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password from the API,\nhowever it may be required to give access to your account (ie. logging in).\n\n\n# **Site usage by children**\n\nIf this server is in the EU or the EEA: Our site, products and services are all directed to people\nwho are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR\n(General Data Protection Regulation) do not use this site.\n\nIf this server is in the USA: Our site, products and services are all directed to people who are at\nleast 13 years old.

                'This privacy policy describes how Sopuli ("Sopuli", "we", "us") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information you may provide through the Sopuli website or its API. The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your engagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and accessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that Sopuli does not own or control, or to individuals that Sopuli does not employ or manage.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging space of free open communication on the internet. **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM DEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.**\n\n**You also understand that although there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP address, due to the nature of federated services, all of your engagement on this platform should be considered public. We feel that proper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to engage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on Sopuli, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n\n# **What information do we collect?**\n\n* **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username, display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n\n* **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**: Communities you subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions which result in it becoming publicly viewable. When you post, the date and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly. Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is available publicly. Your posts are delivered to the communities they are posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise broadcast to other instances, however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. This service interoperates with other federated services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function differently than it does on Lemmy. \n\n**In essence, your IP address and email remain private to this local instance, however due to the nature of federated services all engagement should be considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.** \n  \n* **Direct messages**: All messages are stored and processed on the instance. In some cases it means they are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail to do so. Therefore it\'s important to review the instances of users you are engaging with. **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.**\n\n* **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n\n\n# **What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n\n\n* To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people\'s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities for content discovery.\n\n* To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n\n* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n\n\n# **How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. \n\nWe are disclosing that Lemmy currently does not support SSL for PostgreSQL. This instance has mitigated this security risk by running the PostgreSQL service on the same host as the instance backend, and has blocked all incoming and outgoing network connections to the PostgreSQL service **OR** hosts the PostgreSQL database on a separate server and connects via a secure tunnel. All incoming and outgoing network access to the PostgreSQL server outside of this secured tunnel has been blocked\n\n\n# **What is our data retention policy?**\n\nWe will make a good faith effort to:\n\n* Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 90 days.\n* Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12 months.\n\nYou may irreversibly delete your account at any time. **However, this does not guarantee all instances will be notified or respect the deletion of your public data.**\n\n# **Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer\'s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.\n\n# **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and community posts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different server than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and your voting history. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password from the API, however it may be required to give access to your account (ie. logging in).\n\n# **Site usage by children**\n\nOur site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) do not use this site.\n\n---\n\nThis document is CC-BY-SA.

                "## Please read the following, failure to read will result in your application being denied.\n\nHello! And thank you for choosing to signup to Reddthat!  \nWe are a community that has formed around a few key ideals:\n- Being respectful to everyone!\n- Engaging in thoughtful conversations\n- Sharing what we love about the internet\n- Remembering the human\n\nWe also have a few NSFW communities on reddthat, so if you click on the \"Show NSFW content\" you agree that you are **over the age of 18** and are willing to see NSFW content. (This can be changed in your settings at a later date)\n\nIf this sounds great to you, please follow the next steps to ensure that your application is accepted!\n\n## Before continuing please make sure you:\n\n- Read the rules: [over here](https://reddthat.com/post/9701)\n- Include a community or two you would like to join in the application section below: [list of communities](https://reddthat.com/communities)\n- **AND** also include how many subscribers they have (as a way to prove you are human!)\n\nThank you for your understanding and we cannot wait to see your application. \n\nCheers,  \nThe Reddthat Admin Team\n\n\n----\n# FAQ:\n\n## When will my application be accepted?\nApplications are usually acted upon within 1 hour, but may take longer as it is a manual process. \n\n## How will I know if it's been accepted or denied?\n\nIf you add an email address to your account you will be sent an email when it has been accepted. Emails are only sent upon being accepted. You will not be emailed upon denial.\n\n## I don't want to add an email addresses when you signup, so how will I know?\n\nThat is perfect! Thank you for not giving us your email address. We do not want your email address and we are happy not knowing it and even happier knowing less about you! \n\nPlease attempt to login with the credentials you used, after an hour or two. If you still cannot login, then your account was denied, most likely because you did not read the process above. That is how confident this FAQ is. It happens too often. \n\n## I never received an email/still can't login. What happened?\n\nIf you cannot login to your account, then that means you were denied. Please feel free to attempt to signup again and make sure you follow the above 2 requirements! \n\n## I have no idea what to put in the box below?\n\nPlease read this text in its entirety, it explains what you need to include there.",

Potete aprire una richiesta [cliccando qui](https://feddit.it/c/main), spiegando di cosa parlerà la comunità e come sarà gestita.\n\n📜 Ogni comunità sceglierà in autonomia le sue regole, i suoi moderatori e le sue esigenze. Non sarà tuttavia possibile aprire comunità con contenuti pornografici, illegali o con discriminazioni razziali o di genere.\n\n🚯 Le comunità politiche dovranno accettare e sottoscrivere una clausola sull'antifascismo.\n\n⛔️ Lo spam, i bot e i messaggi ripetuti o molesti saranno rimossi a prescindere dalle regole della comunità.\n\n♻️ Le comunità che non riusciranno ad auto-moderarsi verranno richiamate dagli admin e se non sarà possibile trovare una soluzione verranno eliminate.\n\n#### Come si mantiene Feddit?\n\n🧡 È un progetto indipendente e senza pubblicità, se volete potete aiutare la gestione di questo server con una piccola [donazione ricorrente su LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/Feddit-it) oppure con una [donazione una tantum su Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/fedditit).\n\nGrazie! 🧡\n\n📧 Per informazioni sull'istanza potete scrivere a lemmy@feddit.it",

Si precisa che l'informativa è resa solo per tale sito e non anche per altri siti web eventualmente consultati dall'utente tramite link.\n\n### Titolare del trattamento\n\nTitolare del trattamento è Francesco Macchia\n\nemail: francesco.macchia [at] gmail .it \n\n### Quali dati vengono raccolti.\n\nRiguardo a questo punto, dobbiamo distinguere due passaggi.\n\n(a) Registrazione nella community: nome utente, password ed e-mail;\n\n(b) Accesso alla comunità e attività dell'utente: indirizzo IP, nome utente, password ed e-mail.\n\nI dati dell'utente (username, password ed email) vengono registrati nel database e, nello specifico, le password vengono convertite in “hash” (ovvero trasformate in stringhe alfanumeriche mediante la funzione hash).\n\n### Accesso alla comunità e alle attività degli utenti\n\nDopo aver completato il processo di creazione dell'account, l'utente può accedere (Login) alla comunità tramite il browser, quindi viene acquisito l'indirizzo IP.\n\n*Ogni utente è responsabile dei contenuti che intende pubblicare sulla community di feddit.it.*\n\nIn questa fase, i dati personali degli utenti raccolti sono *username , password , indirizzo email e indirizzo IP.*\n\n### Chi può accedere ai dati e per quali attività.\n\nL'amministratore del server (istanza) può leggere i dati delle attività svolte sulla community registrati sul server e precisamente nel database o nei file di log (username, email, indirizzo IP, indirizzo web della community, tipo di attività - tecnicamente GET o POST).\n\nL'amministratore accede ai dati personali degli utenti solo per motivi strettamente tecnici (analisi del sistema, aggiornamento dei pacchetti applicativi, esigenze di manutenzione).\n\nSi precisa che l'accesso ai dati personali degli utenti, sia nel database che nei log, è un'attività specifica che generalmente non viene svolta se non per risolvere conflitti o errori particolari.\n\n### Le finalità del trattamento.\n\nLo scopo è consultare questo sito web o interagire pubblicando contenuti, commenti o creando altre community. L'accesso a questo sito Web e la richiesta di registrazione come utente implicano che l'utente ha prestato il proprio consenso.\n\nInoltre, le finalità sono anche legate alla manutenzione dei server e agli aggiornamenti di sistemi e applicazioni.\n\nL'invio facoltativo, esplicito e volontario di posta elettronica agli indirizzi indicati su questo sito comporta la successiva acquisizione dell'indirizzo del mittente, necessario per le risposte, nonché degli eventuali altri dati personali inseriti nella missiva. Tali dati sono trattati per rispondere ai messaggi inviati e gestire le relative richieste. Il mancato conferimento dei dati personali per le comunicazioni con noi o l'invio di richieste impedirà di evaderli. Conserviamo i dati per il tempo strettamente necessario alle finalità legate al trattamento dei dati.\n\n### Base giuridica del trattamento\n\nIl trattamento dei dati personali è basato sul consenso - ai sensi dell'art. 6, par. 1, lettera a) del Regolamento UE 2016/679 - espressa dall'utente con la navigazione in questo sito web e la sua consultazione, accettando così la presente informativa.\n\nIl consenso è facoltativo, e l'utente può revocarlo in qualsiasi momento mediante richiesta inviata via email all'indirizzo francesco.macchia [at] gmail.com , precisando che, in tal caso, qualora l'utente non acconsenta, non potrà consultare il presente sito web, né registrarsi né rimanere come utente registrato.\n\nPer quanto riguarda la manutenzione dei server e gli aggiornamenti di sistemi e applicazioni, la base giuridica è il legittimo interesse ai sensi dell'articolo 6, lettera f) del Regolamento UE 2016/679.\n\nIl trattamento dei dati personali è necessario per il perseguimento del legittimo interesse del titolare del trattamento a fornire informazioni in merito a studi e ricerche, ai sensi dell'art. 6, par. 1, lettera f) del Regolamento UE 2016/679, in conformità a quanto previsto dal medesimo Regolamento.\n\n### Cookies\n\nGli unici cookie sono *solo quelli funzionali* e, quindi, nessuna attività di profilazione o tracciamento.\n\n*Pertanto, questo sito non utilizza cookie diversi dai cookie funzionali esclusivamente per le finalità funzionali sopra descritte e la loro installazione non richiede il consenso dell'utente.*\n\n### Destinatari dei dati\n\nNon comunichiamo a destinatari o categorie di destinatari i dati personali raccolti da questo sito web a seguito della sua consultazione.\n\n### Periodo di conservazione dei dati personali\n\nA parte quanto sopra specificato, i dati raccolti da questo sito durante il suo funzionamento sono conservati per il tempo strettamente necessario alle attività precisate. I dati saranno cancellati o anonimizzati alla data di scadenza a meno che non sussistano altre finalità di conservazione degli stessi. Per scopi di analisi (statistiche), utilizziamo Matomo ma a condizione che tu abbia acconsentito a ciò fornendo il consenso una volta raggiunto questo sito.\n\n### Trasferimento di dati personali verso un paese terzo o un'organizzazione internazionale\n\nIl sito feddit.it, in quanto completamente basato sul progetto Lemmy, dispone di un sistema che consente di generare un feed per ciascun oggetto della comunità. I dati riportati nel messaggio non sono costituiti da dati personali e consistono in:\n\n- username dell'utente\n\n- Titolo del post\n\n- Identificativo della comunità feddit nella quale è stato pubblicato\n\n- Data di pubblicazione\n\n- Testo del messaggio\n\n- Link pubblicato dall'autore del messaggio\n\n- Link del messaggio\n\nQuesta peculiarità della piattaforma Lemmy e il fatto che tali dati non possano essere considerati come \"dati personali\" consente a chiunque di operare un trattamento massivo e automatizzato di tali dati, per qualunque fine consentito dalla normativa nazionale ed europea.\nAttualmente esiste già un sistema di ripubblicazione automatica che provvede a copiare sul canale Telegram https://t.me/feddit e sul profilo Twitter https://twitter.com/feddit_it tutti i post di apertura pubblicati all'interno delle comunità.\n\nResta fermo il fatto che il titolare del trattamento, l'amministratore dell'istanza di Lemmy, non trasferisce i dati al di fuori dello Spazio Economico Europeo (SEE) dal momento che Lemmy è installato sul server situato all'interno dello Spazio Economico Europeo.\n\nCi sembra opportuno chiarire meglio.\n\nGli utenti registrati su un'istanza sono sempre gli unici responsabili delle loro attività creando comunità o pubblicando post o commenti.\n\nNon vi è alcun trasferimento al di fuori del SEE quando gli utenti registrati su un'istanza all'interno dello stesso SEE eseguono attività sullo stesso server (istanza). Ad esempio, la nostra istanza ( https://feddit.it) si trova in Italia e quindi all'interno del SEE. Se gli utenti registrati sulla nostra istanza eseguono attività sul nostro server, non vi è alcun trasferimento di dati al di fuori del SEE. Allo stesso modo, non vi è alcun trasferimento di dati al di fuori del SEE anche se gli utenti registrati sulla nostra istanza si iscrivono, pubblicano post o commenti su altre istanze, ad esempio, situate al di fuori del SEE. Infatti, in quest'ultimo caso, il nostro amministratore di istanza può accedere ai log e vedere solo il dominio (e quindi nemmeno l'URL completo della community su cui si svolgono le attività) e il suo indirizzo IP. Nessun ulteriore dato dell'utente viene trasferito al di fuori del SEE dall'amministratore o automaticamente dalla piattaforma Lemmy. L'utente deve essere consapevole che il proprio nome utente è costituito nella forma \"@username@domainofcommunity\" (ad esempio, nel nostro caso, @username@feddit.it.\n\nNon ci sarà alcun trasferimento di dati al di fuori del SEE anche se l'utente intende creare una comunità sull'istanza Lemmy esistente all'interno dello stesso SEE.\n\nTutto questo perché è una funzione propria del sistema fediverse e del protocollo ActivityPub utilizzato da Lemmy.\n\n### Misure di sicurezza\n\nI dati dei visitatori o degli utenti sono trattati in modo lecito e secondo correttezza, adottando le opportune misure di sicurezza volte ad impedire accessi non autorizzati, divulgazione, modifica o distruzione non autorizzata dei dati. I tuoi dati nella sessione di comunicazione con questo sito Web sono protetti da un certificato Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) che utilizza un protocollo di presentazione crittografico, crittografando le informazioni.\n\n### Diritti degli interessati\n\nGli utenti (interessati) di questo sito web possono esercitare i diritti di cui agli artt. da 15 a 22 del Regolamento UE 2016/679. Puoi inoltrare tutte le richieste per esercitare tali diritti scrivendo a francesco.macchia [at] gmail.com\n\n### Diritto di sporgere denuncia\n\nQualora l'interessato ritenga che il trattamento dei dati personali che lo riguardano effettuato attraverso questo sito violi il Regolamento, ha il diritto di proporre reclamo al Garante ai sensi dell'art. 77 del Regolamento UE 2016/679.\n\n### Attribuzione\n\nParti di questi termini di servizio sono state prese da eupolicy.social e adattate da https://mastodon.nicfab.it/privacy-policy#Informativa_Privacy_IT.",

As of right now, the main rules would be:\n\n**1. Don't do anything illegal** - anything against the law is basically prohibited here. We'd like to keep our instance relatively above board.\n\n**2. Stay on topic for the communities** - Stay on topic for the community you're posting in. Also respect their rules. The rules of which are left up to the mods of said community.\n\n**3. Be kind and respectful** - We want this to be a positive place, regardless of a person's ideals, values, and opinions. Just remember the person on the other side of the screen. Hate speech, name calling, or other rude/derogatory behavior is not generally allowed.\n\n**4. Please respect the rules of and do not harass others in remote or local communities** - The fediverse is a wide, wide place. There's multiple communities in existence that even predate our instance here dedicated to the subject of TTRPGs! Please don't go into other communities and disrespect their space. You can even subscribe and participate in those communities in addition to ours!\n\n**As of right now, we have no blanket rule on NSFW content. Due to the nature of TTRPGs depicting all sorts of sex, violence, drugs, and other adult themes, we don't plan on trying to limit this globally. This will be left up to the community in question to decide of NSFW posts/discussion/images fit in line with the community content and values.** We're willing to revisit this idea if there's an extreme desire by the community at large one way or the other, but for now, this is where we stand.\n\n**However, all NSFW posts are required to be tagged as such.**",

                'Welcome!\n\nMander is a Lemmy instance to share science and nature related content. We can discuss about growing mushrooms, physics, electronics, engineering, discuss scientific papers, and discuss about other STEM and nature related topics. The policy is to try to stay way from politics and polarizing topics as much as possible when it comes to content posted locally, but you are of course free to post and engage with such content in communities that allow it and live in other instances. \n\nThe purpose of this application section is to weed out the many bots that register to the site to post ad spam. So, please make a comment about why you are interested in joining this instance, making a specific mention of science and/or nature. \n\nYour response does not need to be long, just specific. For example, a response such as "I am a physics enthusiast and I am interested in this instance\'s communities" is ok . A response like "ok", "let me in please", or "reddit refugee checking out the fediverse" is too generic and bot-like, does not address science at all, and so it would be rejected. \n\nIncluding your e-mail can be helpful for receiving a notification when your application is approved and for resetting your password if you forget it, but it is **NOT** required, and you can always add it later if you need to. If you leave the e-mail field empty, simply try to log-in later to check your application status.\n\n',

The idea is to have a fast, stable instance and allow users to subscribe to whatever content they want from here. \n\n😎  We dont block any other instances. We will keep it that way unless it becomes a moderation problem.\n\n🤠 We will be around for a very long time, so you dont have to worry about us shutting down the instance anytime soon. We like performance and stability in our servers, and will upgrade the instance when its needed.\n\n🥹 Make sure to join **a lot** of remote communities to get a good feed going. How to do that is explained [here](https://lemmy.today/post/168392).\n\n#### Optional Lemmy user interfaces\n\n- https://old.lemmy.today\n- https://photon.lemmy.today\n- https://m.lemmy.today\n- https://alexandrite.lemmy.today\n\n#### Lemmy mobile apps\n\n- [Sync for Lemmy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.syncapps.lemmy_sync) (Android)\n- [Boost for Lemmy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubenmayayo.lemmy) (Android)\n- [Liftoff](https://github.com/liftoff-app/liftoff) (Android and IOS)\n- [Voyager](https://vger.app/posts/lemmy.today/all) (web application but has  [IOS app in Testflight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/nWLw1MBM))\n- [Jerboa](https://github.com/dessalines/jerboa) (Android)\n- [Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kuroneko.lemmy_connect) (Android)\n- [Thunder](https://github.com/thunder-app/thunder) (Android and IOS)\n- [Mlem](https://github.com/mlemgroup/mormaer-mlem) (IOS)\n- [Memmy](https://github.com/Memmy-App/memmy) (IOS)\n\n#### Rules\n\n- Be respectful.

                "**Privacy Policy**\n\nWe provide this information according to the EU Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) for those who consult the website https://monero.town and request to register. Note that this information applies only to that website and not to other websites the user may consult through links.\n\n**Data controller**\n\nThe data controller is [@admin@monero.town](https://monero.town/u/admin). \n\n**What data is collected.**\n\nRegarding this point, we must distinguish two steps.\n\n(a) Registration in the community: username, password;\n\n(b) Access to the community and user activities: IP address, username, password.\n\nThe user data (username, password) are recorded in the database, and specifically, the passwords are “hashed” (i.e., transformed into alphanumeric strings using the hash function).\n\n**Access to the community and user activities**\n\nHaving completed the account creation process, the user can log in (Login) to the community through the browser, the IP address is acquired.\n\nEach user is responsible for the content they intend to post on the Lemmy community.\n\nIn that phase, the personal data of users collected are the username, password and IP address.\n\n**Who can access the data and for what activities.**\n\nThe server administrator (instance) can read data of the activities performed on the community recorded on the server and precisely in the database or log files (username, IP address, community web address, type of activity - technically GET or POST).\n\nThe administrator only accesses users’ personal data for strictly technical reasons.\n\nWe should point out that access to users’ personal data, whether in the database or logs, is a specific activity that is not generally performed except to resolve particular conflicts or errors.\n\n**The purposes of the processing.**\n\nThe purpose is to consult this website or interact by posting content, comments, or creating other communities. Accessing this website, and requesting to register as a user, means the user gave consent.\n\nFurthermore, the purposes are also related to server maintenance and system and application upgrades.\n\nThe optional, explicit, and voluntary sending of electronic mail to the addresses indicated on this site involves the acquisition of the sender’s address necessary for the replies and any other personal data contained in the message. These data are processed to respond to messages sent and handle related requests. Failure to provide personal data for communications with us or send requests will prevent evading them. We store data for the time strictly necessary for the purposes related to data processing.\n\n**Legal basis for the processing**\n\nThe processing of personal data is based on consent - according to article 6, par. 1, letter a) of EU Regulation 2016/679 - expressed by the user by browsing this website and its consultation, thus accepting this information.\n\nConsent is optional, and the user can withdraw at any time by request sent by email to monerobull@protonmail.com, specifying that, in this case, whether the user does not consent, they cannot consult this website, either register or remain as a registered user.\n\nRegarding server maintenance and system and application upgrades, the legal basis is the legitimate interest according to Article 6, letter f) of the EU Regulation 2016/679.\n\n**Cookies**\n\nThe only cookies are only functional ones and, therefore, no profiling or tracking activities.\n\nThus, this site does not use cookies other than functional cookies solely for the functional purposes described above, and their installation does not require the user’s consent.\n\n**Data recipients**\n\nWe do not communicate personal data collected from this website following its consultation to recipients or categories of recipients.\n\n**Period for storing personal data**\n\nApart from what is specified above, the data collected by this website during its operation are stored for the time strictly necessary for the activities specified. The data will be deleted or anonymized at the expiry date unless there are no other purposes for storing the same.\n\n**Transferring personal data to a third country or international organization**\n\nThe data controller, the administrator of Lemmy’s instance, does not transfer data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) if Lemmy is installed on the server located within the European Economic Area.\n\nWe feel it is appropriate to clarify this further.\n\nUsers registered on an instance are always solely responsible for their activities by creating communities or publishing posts or comments.\n\nThere is no transfer outside the SEE when registered users on an instance within the same EEA perform activities on the same server (instance). For example, our instance (https://monero.town) is located in Lithuania and thus within the EEA. If users registered on our instance perform activities on our server, there is no data transfer outside the EEA. Similarly, there is no data transfer outside the EEA even if registered users on our instance subscribe, publish posts, or comments on other instances - for example - located outside the EEA. Indeed, in the latter case, our instance administrator can access the logs and see only the domain (and thus not even the full URL of the community on which activities are performed) and its IP address. No further user data is transferred outside the EEA by the administrator or automatically by the Lemmy platform. The user should be aware that their username in the form “@username@domainofcommunity” (e.g., in our case, @username@monero.town) will be visible in the community in which they have intervened (e.g., to publish posts or comments).\n\nThere will be no transfer of data outside the EEA even if the user intends to create a community on the existing Lemmy instance within the same EEA.\n\nAll of this is because it is a proper function of the fediverse’s system and the ActivityPub protocol used by Lemmy.\n\n**Security measures**\n\nVisitors’ or users’ data are processed lawfully and correctly by adopting appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of data. Your data in the communication session with this website are protected by a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate that uses a cryptographic presentation protocol, encrypting the information.\n\n**Data subjects’ rights**\n\nUsers (data subject) of this website may exercise the rights according to Articles 15 to 22 of EU Regulation 2016/679. You can lodge all requests to exercise these rights by writing to monerobull@protonmail.com\n\n**Right to lodge a complaint**\n\nWhether a data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to them as performed via this website infringes the Regulation, they have the right to lodge a complaint with the Garante according to Article 77 of the EU Regulation 2016/679.\n",

Users can create and moderate their own communities!  \n**Registrations:** open, with manual approval to prevent abuse  \n**Notable rules:** \n* No underage characters.\n* All NSFW content must be appropriately flagged.\n* All posts must have attribution and the DNP list must be respected.\n* Sharing content that is behind a pay wall (piracy) is strictly forbidden.\n* Real NSFW photos and videos are only allowed if they are related to the submitter (eg. a selfie). This is to prevent distribution of sensitive photos without permission of the people depicted in them.\n* Posting via bots is allowed as long as long as it's within the established frequency limits.\n\nWhile unusual if you're not familiar with furry artwork, this instance's content is safe and legal to federate with.\n\nFor a full list of rules and recommended communities, [**visit this pinned post.**](https://yiffit.net/post/20)\n\nDNP, Takedown requests or inquiries can be sent to [@Wander@yiffit.net](https://yiffit.net/u/Wander) (Fediverse) or wanderpackmatesorg (email).\n\nIf you're a moderator of a furry or yiff subreddit and would like to jump on board of the moderation team at Yiffit, please let us know!",

                "PRIVACY POLICY\n\nYiffit.net is a service that allows you to send and receive social content such as text posts, links, images, comments, direct messages etc. as well as sending and receiving social interactions such as upvotes, downvotes, bookmarks, etc. to and from users across the internet.\n\nYiffit.net's software, known as Lemmy, works by creating for each of its users both an inbox and outbox with which they can receive and send social content over the internet. \n\nUsers can receive content from both other Yiffit.net users and communities (local) as well as users and communities from across the internet (remote). Content from this inbox is then displayed in form of a \"feed\" or \"timeline\", representing a list of content such as posts and comments which the user has subscribed to or might find interesting.\n\nWhen creating new content or performing an action that interacts with existing content or users, Yiffit.net's server will place this interaction in the user's outbox and immediately deliver it on the user's behalf to all known (by the Yiffit.net server) users and communities across the internet as part of the process of communicating these social interactions and being able to offer a social network experience.\n\nWhen a remote user, community or server requests information about social content hosted on Yiffit.net (for example, when trying to access the user's profile), Yiffit.net will also send on behalf of the user a list of social interactions that are part of the user's public profile.\n\nIn summary: in order to be able to provide a social network experience with users who are not members of Yiffit.net, the user authorizes Yiffit.net to request content and send content on the user's behalf to and from other users, communities and servers across the internet. Yiffit.net acts thus as a messaging system to receive and send social content and interactions to and from across the internet and then display them on screen in a coherent way that allows the user to read the content and interact with it.\n\nSending and receiving social content and interactions to and from other users on the internet is similar to email. Yiffit.net does not control, own or have access to the inbox of remote users, communities and servers. \n\n**By using the website Yiffit.net the user understands and accepts that the content of any interaction such as messages, posts, upvotes, downvotes, bookmarks, etc... is immediately sent and delivered across the internet.** As such, the user understands and accepts that any content and interaction is inherently public and that it is not possible to guarantee the removal or deletion of any copies of such interactions that were delivered to remote users, communities and servers across the internet.\n\n**Yiffit.net never shares or sends personal identifiable information such as IP addresses, email addresses or browsing meta-data.** Yiffit.net will only send on behalf of the user interactions that they have performed on the site as well as public details that make up the user's social profile such as username, profile description, profile photo, profile banner, etc.\n\nSince the nature of the social interactions on Yiffit.net is public, we recommend users to choose a username that will not publicly identify them unless they willingly decide to do so and understand that any interactions on the site may be public, as well as the fact that Yiffit.net has no ability to control or remove data from the inbox of remote servers after such an interaction has been sent out. We can only request that remote servers delete or hide content that has already been received by them, but we have no ability to enforce its removal.\n\nIt is worth noting that \"direct messages\" to other users are only sent to the server where the other user has their inbox. If the recipient of a direct message is a Yiffit.net user, then that message will NOT be broadcast or sent across the internet. When direct messages are sent to non-yiffit.net users, then they are sent in an encrypted and secure manner with the use of TLS certificates. However, it's worth noting that once they have arrived at their destination, direct messages are not stored in an encrypted manner in the database and that any person managing the server where the remote inbox is located could potentially have access to their message. So called Direct Messages are an exception to most if not all other social interactions on Yiffit.net which are almost always public in nature, and even Direct Messages shoud not be used to convey critically sensitive information due to the risk of being read by malicious remote server administrators.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Yiffit.net will not send out images to remote servers. Images are hosted by Yiffit.net and will have to be requested to our server for them to be displayed to remote users. However, we do not have the ability to guarantee that remote servers or users will not cache them or save a copy.\n\n**The user accepts and agrees not to hold Yiffit.net, its administrators, moderators and users liable for any damages, negative consequences, impact to their reputation, financial losses, etc. that derive from Yiffit.net fulfilling its role and task as a service to receive, deliver and publicly broadcast the social content and interactions that the user does when using the social platform offered by Yiffit.net**\n\nThe user also understands and accepts that due to the way the software Yiffit.net uses works (lemmy), that currently any messages the user deletes are still visible by administrators and community moderators (only the community they were sent in), whether local or remote. We do not like this behavior for deleted messages and will work in the following months to implement features that allow users to delete messages and broadcast a request to other servers to also delete this content, not just hide it from users.\n\nCurrently we recommend our users to edit their message before deleting them. Lemmy does not keep version history and this should ensure that content is removed by replacing it with any other arbitrary content (or leaving it blank) as long as remote servers accept the user's request to alter the content, to hide it from users, to not keep a version history or to delete it from its database. Yiffit.net can not guarantee that remote users, communities or servers will comply with such requests and we recommend our users treat everything they write or do on this platform as irreversibly public. Please consider our recommendation to use an alias as a username to protect your privacy.\n\nYiffit.net is a non-commercial personal project. By using Yiffit.net the user accepts and understands that there are no guarantees of availability and that the administrator of Yiffit.net may not be held liable for any negative consequences suffered if the site stops working, were to disappear completely, any loss of data and/or bugs in the software that Yiffit.net uses to provide this voluntary and private service. That said, we will do our best to keep the uptime as high as possible. In the case of permanent service closure we aim to announce it with at least 3 months of anticipation.\n\nWe are committed to the utmost care in regards to personal identifying information, ensuring that we never share or disclose such information to unauthorized third parties. Please find below a list of persons or companies who are authorized to hold, transfer or work with your data in order to be able to make Yiffit.net work.\n\nOther relevant information:\n\n- Yiffit.net is hosted on a dedicated server in Germany. Backups are also hosted in Germany.\n- Only @Wander@yiffit.net has access to the server and the data that it contains.\n- Mailjet.com is our email delivery provider and they have access to your email and other information contained within those emails in order to be able to send you emails.\n- Cloudflare R2 is our object storage provider. We are using their 'western europe' endpoint.\n- Cloudflare is also used to protect our server from DDoS attacks and technically could see data in transit.\n- Site admins and moderators cannot access your email address or IP address.\n- IP logs are retained for 14 days for moderation purposes only (ie. detect and prevent abuse by malicious actors registering multiple accounts)",

It is completely free and open, and not controlled by any company. This means that there is no advertising, tracking, or secret algorithms. Content is organised into communities, so it is easy to subscribe to topics that you are interested in, and ignore others. Voting is used to bring the most interesting items to the top.\n\n**Hint:** If you can't find the community you'd like to join in the [All Communities](https://leminal.space/communities?listingType=All&amp;page=0) section, try searching for it on [Lemmyverse](https://lemmyverse.net/communities) or the [Feddit.de community browser](https://browse.feddit.de/), then copy and paste the community link in the [Search](https://leminal.space/search?type=Communities&amp;listingType=All&amp;page=1&amp;sort=TopAll) box.\n\n**Featured Communities:**\n- [!technology@lemmy.world](https://leminal.space/c/technology@lemmy.world)\n- [!asklemmy@lemmy.ml](https://leminal.space/c/asklemmy@lemmy.ml)\n- [!mildlyinteresting@lemmy.world](https://leminal.space/c/mildlyinteresting@lemmy.world)\n- [!melbourne@aussie.zone](https://leminal.space/c/melbourne@aussie.zone)\n- [!news@hexbear.net](https://leminal.space/c/news@hexbear.net)\n- [!worldnews@lemmy.ml](https://leminal.space/c/worldnews@lemmy.ml)\n\n### Rules\n1.

While this is tacitly covered by rule #1, for the sake of clarity: this is not the place for fascist or alt-right discourse.\n3. Be respectful. Everyone should feel welcome.\n4. No pornography.\n5.

Blogs are fine as long as they have original content or add significant content to news or issue. \n* This is a community Lemmy instance so be respectful of other users.\n* No trolling and no shitposting. Low quality posts and comments will be removed without warning. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n* Avoid comparing various desktop environments and/or distros. This community is about the KDE community and not about stupid flamewars between open source projects.\n* In case of doubt, consult KDE's [Code of conduct](https://kde.org/code-of-conduct/). Violations of the CoC will result in banning.\n---\n\n**KDE** is a commmunity creating free and open source software for desktop and portable computing.  \n\n---\n\n**KDE Websites**\n\n* [KDE Homepage](https://kde.org)\n* [KDE News](https://dot.kde.org)\n* [KDE Blogs](https://planetkde.org)\n* [KDE Discuss (Forum/Discourse)](https://discuss.kde.org/)\n* [KDE Wikis](https://wiki.kde.org/)\n* [KDE Bug tracker and reporter](https://bugs.kde.org/)\n\n---\n\n**Donate to KDE**\n\n* [Become an official Supporting Member](https://kde.org/fundraisers/plasma6member/)\n\n* [Help fund KDE projects with a one-off donation](https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2022/)\n\n---\n\n**Want to contribute to KDE?**\n\nFor starters:\n\n* The best way to start contributing is to contact the community over [Matrix](https://community.kde.org/Matrix) and [IRC](https://userbase.kde.org/IRC_Channels)\n\n* At first sight, it might seem a bit hard to interact in those groups. That's okay! Join them first, see how things are done, mention your interest and where you'd like to work with. We may even find a [mentor](https://community.kde.org/Mentoring) for you!\n\n* The KDE Community develops and distributes open source software. As such, we follow a sort of do-ocracy wherein tasks are done and assigned by contributors themselves. Feel free to pick an area and just start contributing immediately! We're always here to help you along the way. A good way to contribute with code for the first time is to fix an unfixed bug that afflicts you or [assign yourself to junior jobs](https://community.kde.org/KDE/Junior_Jobs) and start working on them.\n\n* It's always nice to collaborate optimally with others in any given setting, but this is especially important for community projects like those following the open source model, so remember to read the [KDE Code of Conduct](https://kde.org/code-of-conduct/).\n\nHere are a few links to help you in your first contributions to KDE:\n\n* [Get Involved](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved)\n\n* [Your first commit](https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/GitLab)\n\n* [Write code](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development)\n\n* [Report issues](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/Issue_Reporting)\n\n* [Triage bug reports](https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Bug_triaging)\n\n* [Translate software and documentation](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/translation)\n\n* [Design applications and icons](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/design)\n\n* [Write documentation](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/documentation)\n\n* [Manage websites and backends](https://community.kde.org/KDE.org)\n\n* [Support other users](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/support)\n\n* [Promote KDE](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/promotion)\n\n* [Make KDE software more accessible](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/accessibility)\n\n* [Assist with management and organization](https://community.kde.org/Gardening)\n\n* [Update the wikis](https://userbase.kde.org/Tasks_and_Tools)\n\n---\n\nGet started learning QML:\n\n* [The new KDE intro to QML](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/widget/qml/)\n\n* [The original Plasma Developer Guide](https://community.kde.org/Plasma/DeveloperGuide)\n\n* [Test QML code live](https://qmlonline.kde.org/)\n\n* [Comprehensive community book on QML](https://qmlbook.github.io/)\n\n* [The official KDAB YouTube course on QML](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6CJYn40gN6hdNC1IGQZfVI707dh9DPRc)\n\n* [The official Qt documentation on QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-tutorial.html)\n\n---\n\nGet started learning C++:\n\n* [The new KDE intro to C++](https://develop.kde.org/docs/getting-started/hello_world/)\n\n* [An app to more easily create apps with a template, KAppTemplate](https://userbase.kde.org/KAppTemplate)\n\n* [The free edX course by New York University](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-programming-in-c)\n\n* [The freemium Codecademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus)\n\n* [Comprehensive wikibook for C++](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming)\n\n* [The Wikiversity C++ course](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)\n\n* [The LearnCPP tutorial website](https://www.learncpp.com/)\n\n* [The CPlusPlus tutorial website](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)\n\n---\nKDE logo copyright KDE e.V. and Oxygen Icons under the [LGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt)",

The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your engagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and accessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that endlesstalk.org does not own or control, or to individuals that endlesstalk.org does not employ or manage.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging space of free open communication on the internet. **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM DEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.**\n\n**You also understand that although there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP address, due to the nature of federated services, all of your engagement on this platform should be considered public. We feel that proper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to engage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on endlesstalk.org, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n\n\n# **What information do we collect?**\n\n\n\n* **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username, display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n* **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**: Communities you subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions which result in it becoming publicly viewable. When you post, the date and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly. Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is available publicly. Your posts are delivered to the communities they are posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise broadcast to other instances, however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. This service interoperates with other federated services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function differently than it does on Lemmy. \\\n \\\n**In essence, your IP address and email remain private to this local instance, however due to the nature of federated services all engagement should be considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.** \n  \n* **Direct messages**: All messages are stored and processed on the instance. In some cases it means they are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail to do so. Therefore it\'s important to review the instances of users you are engaging with. **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.**\n* **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n\n\n# **What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n\n\n* To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people\'s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities for content discovery.\n* To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n\n\n# **How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. \n\nWe are disclosing that Lemmy currently does not support SSL for PostgreSQL. This instance has mitigated this security risk by running the PostgreSQL service on the same host as the instance backend, and has blocked all incoming and outgoing network connections to the PostgreSQL\n\n\n\n# **What is our data retention policy?**\n\nWe will make a good faith effort to:\n\n\n\n* Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 90 days.\n* Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12 months.\n\nYou may irreversibly delete your account at any time. **However, this does not guarantee all instances will be notified or respect the deletion of your public data.**\n\n\n\n# **Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer\'s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.\n\n\n# **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and community posts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different server than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and your voting history. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password from the API, however it may be required to give access to your account (ie. logging in).\n\n\n# **Site usage by children**\n\nIf this server is in the EU or the EEA: Our site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) do not use this site.\n\nIf this server is in the USA: Our site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old. If you are under the age of 13, per the requirements of COPPA (Children\'s Online Privacy Protection Act) do not use this site.\n\nLaw requirements can be different if this server is in another jurisdiction.',

                "#### Community Guidelines (work in progress)\n\nWelcome! MTGZone is a collection of Magic: the Gathering communities within the Lemmy social news network. \n\nWe have some basic rules community guidelines for membership and contributions here, and we hope you help make this community grow into a friendly, useful resource for fellow players and collectors!\n\n1. **Registrations are currently open!** \n\n   Email verification is required. \n\n   Due to spam/bot issues with Lemmy we also currently require that you answer one question and that an admin review all signups. We try to get to them asap and perhaps soon we'll remove this limitation and just enable captcha.\n\n   ---\n\n2. **Downvotes are enabled.** \n\n   Please reserve downvoting for content that doesn't contribute to the communities or discussions here, or for content you think doesn't belong.\n\n   ---\n\n3. **Communities are currently fixed** and not open for anyone to create. \n\n   We may open them up in the future but as we try to grow the user base we want to try to curate content a bit and keep the site focused for now.\n\n   ---\n\n4. **Please follow the [golden rule](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Golden_Rule)** in all interactions here! \n\n   Be kind to others and give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\n   ---\n\n5. **Specific content rules:**\n   * **Keep it related to MTG!** All content must be related to the greatest game ever made, Magic: the Gathering.\n   * **No advertising.** Promoting your content is totally fine and encouraged, but direct commercial advertisements are not allowed.\n   * **No abusive language.** Swearing in general is not prohibited, but no direct insults toward other members.\n   * **No politics.** Please do not discuss general political news, issues, or the political views of others. The only exception is for things that very specifically relate to Magic: the Gathering **_the game_** or Wizards of the Coast's curation of **_the game_** itself. Discussion on [WOTC shareholder disputes](https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/hasbro-rejects-finkel-alta-foxs-offer-to-spin-off-wotc-adds-two-new-board-members/) are fine as it affects the game, an artist's personal political views are not as it has no impact on the game. Please use your best judgment; we'll always explain decisions but will probably be fairly restrictive.\n   * **No pornography.** No nudity or pornographic alters, real or fictional.\n   * **No bigotry.** Everyone is welcome here. Please do not post content that outwardly or obviously targets others' race, religion, etc. Keep it kind, folks!\n\n   ---\n\n6. **Have fun!** \n\n   We're not Reddit and we specifically created this place as a greater alternative with the players and community as our sole interest.

Or anyone wanting a fast Lemmy experience in Boulder’\n\nLemmy users are encouraged to use this instance to browse the fediverse. No real content is stored here (other than issues on the official community) but you can create an account then access other federated servers so that you reduce their traffic and help not overload them. This helps keep other Lemmy instances fast and working. If they go down you can still access other Lemmy communities. Or just have a backup account (good practice). \n\nServer is reliable and easily run and maintained by keeping everything as simple/cheap as possible wherever I can. Downtime is expected to be minimal due to the design, however there are no bells or whistles. This is a cheap to run instance, and I wont let costs run away.\n\nBlocked instances are any instances that host illegal content I am notified about or spam/troll etc. and is pulled from FediNuke.txt that many instances use to block hostile servers. Nothing more, just don't want a hard time. Don't get onto that list. I don't maintain it, I just use it.\nRules are don't be an idiot and make our lives hard basically or troll/be racist/do illegal stuff. I just want things to be simple. \n\nIf any content is found that is questionable or illegal or any of the usual stuff just report it and it can be deleted. If any admin from another instance needs me to ban any user or bot account just contact me. Happy to remove fake or evil accounts. I like to keep things simple as I said. No drama = everyone is happy.\n\nAny problems just create a support thread or message user ‘Thief’ for help. \nIf you cant create a thread email me at: admin at myserv dot one\n\n![](https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/thumbnail/matrix.org/DmdvzqSxhaSqxhquAyICuUpV?width=30&amp;height=30&amp;method=crop) This server is part of the Federation Of Lemmy Admins - a collection of Lemmy admins that look after each others instances while they are asleep or unavailable, in an effort to improve uptime, reliability and security.",

Let's keep it light and fun. We're practically neighbors.\n- Please participate in a manner that doesn’t promote hatred such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and classism.\n- Please don't use a dmv.social account to subscribe to communities with unlawful, pornographic, or otherwise NSFW content.\n- Let's keep this instance generally SFW. If you're uncomfortable using your phone to view it at work, it probably doesn't belong here.\n- While this is a generally-SFW instance, some topics on here are best suited for adults. Please do not sign up if you are not 18+.\n\nIf you need more detail, the [dmv.social Community Guidelines](https://dmv.social/post/40136) are available. Please review the federation guidelines as well as this instance does not federate with every instance.\n\nLastly, all content posted to this instance federates to other servers by design. When you delete or edit content there is a risk it may still be available on other instances so be judicious in the content you post.\n\n# Actual Application\nIn order to keep out bots, here's a few questions just so we know you're human and read the above:\n\n- What do you like about the area?\n- Will you make a good-faith effort at adhering to the community guidelines?\n- Are you an adult (18+)?\n",

Data Sharing and Disclosure\n\nWe may share your personal data in the following ways:\n\n- **With Other Users**: Your interactions on our federated Lemmy instance, such as posts, comments, and votes, are visible to other users in accordance with Lemmy’s federated architecture (see 4.).\n\n- **With Service Providers**: We may share your personal data with third-party service providers who assist us in operating our platform.\n\n- **Legal Compliance**: We may disclose your personal data if required by law or to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, as well as that of our users and the public.\n\n### 4. Data Transfer to Other Instances\n\nOur federated Lemmy instance operates on a decentralized model, which means that data may be transferred to and shared with other instances within the Fediverse network. This is an inherent feature of the Lemmy platform’s architecture, designed to allow users to interact with content and users across different instances while maintaining control over their data.\n\nWhen you create an account, post content, comment, or engage in any activity on kerala.party, some of your data may be replicated and shared with other instances through a process called federation. This allows users from various instances to view and interact with your content, comments, and activities.\n\nIt’s important to understand that when your data is federated, it remains subject to the privacy policies and terms of use of both kerala.party and the instance to which it is shared. We do not have direct control over how other instances handle your data, and their data protection practices may vary.\n\nWe recommend that you review the privacy policies and terms of use of the instances you interact with to understand how your data may be used, shared, and protected. While we strive to promote responsible data handling and protection within the Fediverse network, it’s essential to be aware of the decentralized nature of the platform and its implications for data transfer.\n\nBy using kerala.party, you acknowledge and consent to the possibility of your data being transferred to other instances as part of the federation process. If you have concerns about data transfer or data protection, please feel free to contact us, and we will do our best to address your inquiries.\n\n### 5. Data Retention\n\nWe will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or as required by law. You may request the deletion of your account and associated data from this instance at any time.\n\n### 6. Your Rights\n\nYou have the right to:\n\n- Access and rectify your personal data.\n\n- Withdraw your consent at any time.\n\n- Request the erasure of your personal data.\n\n- Object to the processing of your personal data.\n\n- Lodge a complaint with a data protection authority.\n\n### 7. Security\n\nWe take reasonable measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as completely secure.\n\n### 8. Contact Us\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at @a10@kerala.party\n\nPlease note that this Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Please check back regularly for any updates.\n\nBy using kerala.party, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and consent to the processing of your personal data as described herein.\n",

                "CitizensGaming.com is a Star Citizen specific Lemmy instance designed to create a better way to share information and content.\n\n### What is Star Citizen\nStar Citizen is an MMO space simulation game currently in development by Cloud Imperium Games. SC allows players to step into the role of a space-faring pilot and engage in a variety of activities like exploration, trading, mining, piracy, bounty hunting and more.\n\nFor more details, check out the community driven wiki: [StarCitizen.tools](https://starcitizen.tools/Frequently_Asked_Questions)\n\nTo join the 'verse, visit the games official website: [RobertSpaceIndustries.com](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/star-citizen)\n\nIf you are a new citizen make sure to use a referal code from a friend, or from the [Referal Code Randomzier](https://gorefer.me/randomizer/STAR#button), when you sign up for an accouint. This will provide you with an extra 5,000 credits of in-game currency.\n\n### Why our own instance\nThe [fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) is full of powerful tools that help communities drive better interaction and content creation. This site is built on the Lemmy platform, which allows individuals from many communites to join a wide range of discussions while also maintaining indepenance from each other.\n\nWhile user adoption has increased across all Lemmy instances, users are still learning how best to utilize the platform. A Star Citizen specific instance lets us create sub-communites for different types of discussion and content; making it easier for us to find and filter the content we're looking for.\n\nThe power of the fediverse is in the development of micro-verses catered to each individual community while also allowing them to connect and interact with any other community that is federated with their own. We should fully embrace that concept by building our community here, where we have full control. \n\n### For help or questions, check the Support community\nLemmy is a fairly new open-source platform that is growing rapidly. If you have any questions about how the software works, or any issues with your accounts, please take a look at the topics in the support community:\n\n!support@citizensgaming.com\n\nYou may also reach out to us at contact@citizensgaming.com\n\n#### Official Resources\n\n[Star Citizen Website](https://robertsspaceindustries.com)\n\n[Offical Forums (IE: Spectrum)](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC)\n\n[Spectrum Dev Comment Tracker](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/community/devtracker#button)\n\n[Official Patch Notes](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/patch-notes)\n\n[Development Progress Tracker](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/roadmap/progress-tracker/teams)\n\n[Game Bug Reports (IE: Issue Council)](https://issue-council.robertsspaceindustries.com/)\n\n#### Community Resources\n\n[Bar Citizen - Community Events](https://barcitizen.sc/)\n\n[List of SC Communities](https://starcitizen.tools/List_of_Star_Citizen_Communities)\n\n[Twitch Directory for Star Citizen](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Star%20Citizen)\n\n[Referal Code Randomizer](https://gorefer.me/randomizer/STAR#button)\n\n#### Other Lemmy SC Communities\n\nTo help us stick together as a community on Lemmy, make sure to subscribe to these as well:\n\n!starcitizen@lemmy.ml\n\n!starcitizen@lemmy.world\n\n",

All the logged in sessions are available for your review and revocation in the settings. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n\n# What do we use your information for?\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n    To provide the core functionality of Mastodon. You can only interact with other people\'s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may follow other people to view their combined posts in your own personalized home timeline.\n    To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n    The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n\n# How do we protect your information?\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.

                "An instance with communities about creating our own content for RPGs and whole new games from scratch. This space is meant as a place to share and throw out interesting ideas that you think could be really cool, and get input and suggestions from other people on how to make them work or be even cooler. The communities are open to material for any game system or any genre or play style.\n\nThe goal here is to throw around wild ideas for other people to make use of or collaborate on developing them further. Discussions about approaches and methods for designing game material can always get heated, but there rarely is any point in arguing about what things people should or should not have in the games they make or run. This does not have to be a space for any one proper way of making game material the right way. Having fun and making new things is what it's about here.\n\nThe rules here are very simple. There are no specific restrictions on what kind of content you want to share and discuss, as long as it is somehow related to creating your own RPG material. Don't be needlessly rude, and attacking specific people or groups won't fly here.\n\nEveryone is welcome, but not all behavior will be tolerated.",

Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of SpoilerTV. The use of the Internet pages of SpoilerTV is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.\n\n\n\nThe processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to SpoilerTV. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.\n\n\n\nAs the controller, SpoilerTV has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.\n\n\n\n1. Definitions\n\n\nThe data protection declaration of SpoilerTV is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.\n\n\n\nIn this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:\n\n\n\n\na)        Personal data\n\n\nPersonal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\n\n\n\nb)        Data subject\n\n\nData subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.\n\n\n\nc)        Processing\n\n\nProcessing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.\n\n\n\nd)        Restriction of processing\n\n\nRestriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.\n\n\n\ne)        Profiling\n\n\nProfiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.\n\n\n\nf)         Pseudonymisation\n\n\nPseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.\n\n\n\ng)        Controller or controller responsible for the processing\n\n\nController or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.\n\n\n\nh)        Processor\n\n\nProcessor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.\n\n\n\ni)          Recipient\n\n\nRecipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.\n\n\n\nj)          Third party\n\n\nThird party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.\n\n\n\nk)        Consent\n\n\nConsent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Name and Address of the controller\n\n\nController for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is:\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoilerTV\n\n\n9 Summers Street\n\n\nPL22 0DH Lostwithiel\n\n\nCornwall\n\n\nEmail: andy@spoilertv.com\n\n\nWebsite: www.spoilertv.com\n\n\n\n3. Name and Address of the Data Protection Officer\n\n\nThe Data Protection Officer of the controller is:\n\n\nAndy Page\n\n\nSpoilerTV\n\n\n9 Summers Street\n\n\nPL22 0DH Lostwithiel\n\n\nEngland\n\n\nEmail: andy@spoilertv.com\n\n\nWebsite: www.spoilertv.com\n\n\n\nAny data subject may, at any time, contact our Data Protection Officer directly with all questions and suggestions concerning data protection.\n\n\n\n4. Cookies\n\n\nThe Internet pages of SpoilerTV use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.\n\n\n\nMany Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.\n\n\n\nThrough the use of cookies, SpoilerTV can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.\n\n\n\nBy means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.\n\n\n\nThe data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.\n\n\n\n5. Collection of general data and information\n\n\nThe website of SpoilerTV collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.\n\n\n\nWhen using these general data and information, SpoilerTV does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, SpoilerTV analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.\n\n\n\n6. Comments function in the blog on the website\n\n\nSpoilerTV offers users the possibility to leave individual comments on individual blog contributions on a blog, which is on the website of the controller. A blog is a web-based, publicly-accessible portal, through which one or more people called bloggers or web-bloggers may post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blogposts.

Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.\n\n\n\nIf a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\n\n\n\n\nd) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)\n\n\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:\n\n\nThe personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.\n\nThe data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.\n\nThe data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.\n\nThe personal data have been unlawfully processed.\n\nThe personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.\n\nThe personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.\n\n\n\nIf one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by SpoilerTV, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. An employee of SpoilerTV shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.\n\n\n\nWhere the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. An employee of SpoilerTV will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.\n\n\n\ne) Right of restriction of processing\n\n\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:\n\n\n\nThe accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.\n\nThe processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests restriction of their use instead.\n\nThe controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\nThe data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.\n\n\n\nIf one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by SpoilerTV, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller. The employee of SpoilerTV will arrange the restriction of the processing.\n\n\n\nf) Right to data portability\n\n\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.

In addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.\n\n\n\nh) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling\n\n\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject's explicit consent.\n\n\n\nIf the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject's explicit consent, SpoilerTV shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.\n\n\n\nIf the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of SpoilerTV.\n\n\n\n\ni) Right to withdraw data protection consent\n\n\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time.\n\n\n\nIf the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of SpoilerTV.\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Facebook\n\n\nOn this website, the controller has integrated components of the enterprise Facebook. Facebook is a social network.\n\n\n\nA social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.\n\n\n\nThe operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States. If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.\n\n\n\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.\n\n\n\nIf the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the \"Like\" button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.\n\n\n\nFacebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.\n\n\n\nThe data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at https://facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition, different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook. These applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.\n\n\n\n11. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google AdSense\n\n\nOn this website, the controller has integrated Google AdSense. Google AdSense is an online service which allows the placement of advertising on third-party sites. Google AdSense is based on an algorithm that selects advertisements displayed on third-party sites to match with the content of the respective third-party site. Google AdSense allows an interest-based targeting of the Internet user, which is implemented by means of generating individual user profiles.\n\n\n\nThe operating company of Google's AdSense component is Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of Google's AdSense component is the integration of advertisements on our website. Google AdSense places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Alphabet Inc. is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google AdSense component is integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google AdSense component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Alphabet Inc. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Alphabet Inc. gains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Alphabet Inc., inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently create commission settlements.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Alphabet Inc. from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. Additionally, cookies already in use by Alphabet Inc. may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Google AdSense also uses so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in web pages to enable a log file recording and a log file analysis through which a statistical analysis may be performed. Based on the embedded tracking pixels, Alphabet Inc. is able to determine if and when a website was opened by a data subject, and which links were clicked on by the data subject. Tracking pixels serve, inter alia, to analyze the flow of visitors on a website.\n\n\n\nThrough Google AdSense, personal data and information—which also includes the IP address, and is necessary for the collection and accounting of the displayed advertisements—is transmitted to Alphabet Inc. in the United States of America. These personal data will be stored and processed in the United States of America. The Alphabet Inc. may disclose the collected personal data through this technical procedure to third parties.\n\n\n\nGoogle AdSense is further explained under the following link https://www.google.com/intl/en/adsense/start/.\n\n\n\n12. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)\n\n\nOn this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.\n\n\n\nFor the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application \"_gat. _anonymizeIp\". By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.\n\n\n\nGoogle Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.\n\n\n\nThe cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.\n\n\n\nFurther information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html. Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link https://www.google.com/analytics/.\n\n\n\n13.

Data protection provisions about the application and use of Instagram\n\n\nOn this website, the controller has integrated components of the service Instagram. Instagram is a service that may be qualified as an audiovisual platform, which allows users to share photos and videos, as well as disseminate such data in other social networks.\n\n\n\nThe operating company of the services offered by Instagram is Instagram LLC, 1 Hacker Way, Building 14 First Floor, Menlo Park, CA, UNITED STATES.\n\n\n\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which an Instagram component (Insta button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download of a display of the corresponding Instagram component of Instagram. During the course of this technical procedure, Instagram becomes aware of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.\n\n\n\nIf the data subject is logged in at the same time on Instagram, Instagram detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Instagram component and is associated with the respective Instagram account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Instagram buttons integrated on our website, then Instagram matches this information with the personal Instagram user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.\n\n\n\nInstagram receives information via the Instagram component that the data subject has visited our website provided that the data subject is logged in at Instagram at the time of the call to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Instagram button or not. If such a transmission of information to Instagram is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she can prevent this by logging off from their Instagram account before a call-up to our website is made.\n\n\n\nFurther information and the applicable data protection provisions of Instagram may be retrieved under https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388 and https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/.\n\n\n\n15.

You may only receive an invite if someone already on the instance recommends you to the moderation team for review.\n\n# Privacy\n\n**Deleted posts remain accessible with the url forever, deleting a post\\comment only removes it from the feed.

                "Ready for the mosh pit, shaka brah!\n\n---\n\nWelcome to the Pricefield corner of Lemmy! Here's a quick list of the communities you may find here:\n\n### [> ♥ Pricefield ♥ <](/c/pricefield@pricefield.org)\n\n### [> Life is Strange <](/c/lifeisstrange@pricefield.org)\n\n### [> LiS Franchise <](/c/lis_franchise@pricefield.org)\n\n### [> Life is Silly <](/c/lifeissilly@pricefield.org)\n\n(feel free to click, we made sure that the links will open on your own instance)\n\n---\n\n**Rules:**\n\nHere are our general rules for the instance. We try to keep these open and general, but individual communities may pose additional restrictions as they see fit.\n\n1. Please follow the [Lemmy Code of Conduct](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/code_of_conduct.html) (tl;dr: be kind and respectful)\n\n2. Absolutely no bigotry, harassment, or discrimination will be tolerated. This includes racism, sexism, all forms of queerphobia, and any other hate speech or marginalization.\n\n3. We'd like to keep the instance LiS-focused. If you'd like to create non-LiS communities, please do it off-instance -- however, any LiS content is welcome here. Is there no community yet for your own fave ship? Make one! We'd love to see it.\n\n    - This doesn't mean you may not use your Pricefield.org account to moderate or create those communities. You're welcome to do whatever you'd like to on Lemmy in general, and if you find any difficulties, please don't hesitate to contact us in the [instance meta community](/c/meta@pricefield.org).\n\n4. Source any fanworks you post (unless you made them of course, then you're the source)\n\n5. Mark NSFW posts as such. Also, if you'd like to post so much NSFW that you'd overrun the instance or communities with it, create dedicated communities instead. We'd like to keep a sex-positive environment here but without forcing it on anyone. (Which means don't be horny in SFW threads.)\n\n    - No \"male gaze\" posts. If you post any lesbian art or other fanwork, make sure it's actually sapphic and not just women performing for a (presumably male) viewer's enjoyment. This is especially relevant to NSFW art, but it applies to all posts, SFW or NSFW.\n\n    - Trans women are women, for those who need the clarification.\n\n6. Do not put spoilers in the title, image, or text content of a post; keep it in the comments for now. We're aware that this is a bit janky but unfortunately there's no way to prevent inadvertently showing spoilers to others for now. If Lemmy implements better rendering of spoilers, we will relax this rule (after some delay to let other instances catch up to the latest version) to the greatest extent that people can still opt out of.\n\n    - Update: 0.18.1 seems to have resolved this. We're monitoring community adoption.\n\n7. Keep the scope of communities in mind. There will be overlaps and you're welcome to crosspost, but make sure the posts you make are relevant to the community you're posting them to. If existing communities are too broad or too specific for your desires, you're welcome to create one and promote it with crossposts.",
